**`I love building stuff`**

I help companies protect their data, reduce risk, and run IT systems that don't fall over when it matters.
Over the past four years, I've been in the trenches with IT ops, security, and SRE—automating deployments, hardening infrastructure, and making sure systems stay up.

I've made security patching 80% faster, built frameworks that actually get used, and automated enough toil to give teams their nights and weekends back.
I think in terms of observability, incident response, and making tradeoffs between velocity and stability—because that's what keeps production running.
If you need someone who understands the reality of managing infrastructure at scale and can bring DevOps and SRE practices that work in the real world,
let's talk
